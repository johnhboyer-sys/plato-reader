              A grammatical description on its own runs once you choose works,
              a speaker, or a word near or not near it. Every term after
              the first can be placed near, before or after term 1; the order
              lock is stronger and overrides those. A window never spans a book
              boundary. Where a term rests on an ambiguous parse, the hit is
              reported as one of several readings.
